# Wound Scanner

## Overview
The Wound Scanner project leverages deep learning to accurately segment and measure wounds from images. Using the U-Net model and PyTorch, this project aims to provide healthcare professionals with precise wound analysis for improved treatment and monitoring.

## Features
- **Accurate Wound Detection**: Utilizes a pre-trained U-Net model to achieve high accuracy in wound segmentation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for uploading images and receiving real-time analysis.
- **Real-Time Analysis**: Optimized for quick and efficient wound assessment.

## Technologies
- **Framework**: PyTorch
- **Model**: U-Net (pre-trained)
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: OpenCV
- **Frontend**: React or Angular (if applicable)
- **Backend**: Node.js or Django (if applicable)

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wound-scanner.git
   cd wound-scanner
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. **Prepare Your Dataset**
   - Ensure your images are stored in the `data/images` directory.
   - Ensure your labels/masks are stored in the `data/masks` directory.

2. **Train the Model**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```

3. **Evaluate the Model**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

4. **Run the Application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

## Pre-Trained Model
This project uses a pre-trained U-Net model to improve segmentation performance. The pre-trained weights can be downloaded from [this link](#) and should be placed in the `models/` directory.

## Results
